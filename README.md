# TV Launcher

TV Launcher (name to be determined) is an Android launcher meant for big screens like televisions. It can be used as a
replacement for the default Leanback or Google TV launcher on various Android TV devices like the Nvidia Shield or
Chromecast with Google TV.

The app is currently in an early development stage.
